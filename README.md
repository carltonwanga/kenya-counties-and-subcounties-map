# Kenya Javascript Friendly Map
Web friendly maps of kenyan counties and sub-counties. The maps are rendered on the browser using [raphael.js](http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/)

The respective counties and sub-county paths have been conveniently labeled to make it easy to target a region for displaying data, DOM manipulation or attaching event handlers.
See demo files on possible map application use cases.


# Svg Files

  - SVG files are also included should there be need to resize the files or use a different web graphics library
